# DataStructures:
* InsertionSort

## About:
Checkout my Data-Structures Library!

## First I will attempt Insertion Sort.
  * It should sort an array
  * It should sort an array of reapeated numbers
  * It should return nil if array is empty
  * It should sort an array of reversed numbers

### Usage:
- Since we are using refinements to 'refine' Array
  we will be able to call insertion_sort as a method
  on an object.

  Example:
  ```Ruby
  unsorted_array.insertion_sort
  ```

- I think this is especially awesome as it allows me
  to customize some methods to work in a specific way I wish.
  This is also a 'double edged sword' it could be potentially dangerous not to mention it would require the rest of the team to conform to this same implementation.  But, in the meantime I think it's a fun experiment.
